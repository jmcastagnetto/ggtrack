# Code of Conduct

## Our Pledge

In the interest of fostering an open and welcoming environment, we as members of the `runapp` community pledge to making participation in our community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body size, disability, ethnicity, gender identity and expression, level of experience, nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.

## Our Standards

We expect our standards to be upheld on any `runapp` community spaces, which can include Slack, GitHub, Twitter, meetups, mailing lists, both online and offline.

Examples of behaviour that contributes to creating a **positive environment** include:

- using welcoming and inclusive language;
- being respectful of differing viewpoints and experiences;
- gracefully accepting constructive criticism;
- focusing on what is best for the community;
- showing empathy towards other community members.

Examples of **unacceptable behaviour** by participants include:

-	the use of sexualized language or imagery and unwelcome sexual attention or advances;
-	trolling, insulting/derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks;
-	public or private harassment;
-	publishing others' private information, such as a physical or electronic address, without explicit permission;
-	other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a professional setting.

When using the community Slack workspace:

-	Avoid using offensive usernames or profile photos which might detract from a friendly, safe and welcoming environment for all.
-	Do not publish text/screenshots of anything shared in Slack without explicit consent from the author. This includes screenshots of private messages to public channels, as well as conversations on public channels to anywhere outside of the `runapp` Slack.
-	Promotion of commercial products and services is allowed if it is relevant to the groupâ€™s purpose, does not saturate communications within Slack and the promoters have demonstrated other contributions to the `runapp` community.


## Our Responsibilities

The `runapp` committee are responsible for clarifying the standards of acceptable behaviour and are expected to take appropriate and fair corrective action in response to any instances of unacceptable behaviour.

On GitHub, the `runapp` committee have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that are not aligned to this Code of Conduct, or to ban temporarily or permanently any contributor for other behaviours that they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies within `runapp` community spaces, and in when an individual is representing the `runapp` community. Examples of representing the community include using an official `runapp` e-mail address, posting via an official social media account, or acting as an appointed representative at an online or offline event.

## Enforcement

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behaviour must be reported by contacting a member of the `runapp` committee via Slack or at william.mackey@grattaninstitute.edu.au. The `runapp` committee will investigate all complaints, and will respond in a way that it deems appropriate to the circumstances. 

The `runapp` committee is obligated to maintain confidentiality with regard to the reporter of an incident. Further details of specific enforcement policies may be posted separately.

`runapp` community members who do not follow or enforce the Code of Conduct in good faith may face temporary or permanent repercussions as determined by other members of the project's leadership.
